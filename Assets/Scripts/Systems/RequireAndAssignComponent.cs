/// Made by SmallBlue, at https://github.com/TheSmallBlue

/// Inspired by Facepunch's S&box and their way of requiring components
/// Basically, this attribute not only creates the component if its missing,
/// But it also automatically sets the variable its applied to! No more GetComponent()s on Awake!

/// For this to work, you need a serialized field whose type is a subclass of a Component.
/// You can serialized a field by either making it public, or by adding the [SerializeField] attribute!
/// Examples:
/// [RequireAndAssignComponent, SerializeField] Rigidbody rb;
/// [RequireAndAssignComponent] public Rigidbody rb;

/// You may also supplement an additional boolean to decide if you want to show the original property field or not!
/// Like so:
/// [RequireAndAssignComponent(true)] public Rigidbody rb;

/// One final note, for this to work correctly you have to focus the gameobject that contains the property once.
/// If you don't, the component will not be added.
